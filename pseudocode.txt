Plan out Endpoint functionality

- GET data
    - Get a list of all invoices in my database
    - What should the endpoint look like? 
        - http://localhost:8000/api/invoices
    - Will it take queries, params, body? 
        - Nope
    - What do I want the response to look like 
        - Should be an array of objects that I can iterate over on my front end 
- ADD data
    - What is the purpose?
        - Duplicate AddInvoiceRow functionality from front end inside of an endpoint handler functionality
    - What should the endpoint look like? 
        - /api/invoice
    - Will it take any queries/params/body?
        - 

- UPDATE data
- DELETE data
